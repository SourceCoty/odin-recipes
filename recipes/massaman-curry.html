    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 large skinless chicken breast <em>cubed</em></li>
        <li>2 tablespoons coconut or avocado oil </li>
        <li>3 medium shallots <em>thinly sliced</em></li>
        <li>3 medium shallots <em>thinly sliced</em></li>
        <li>1 teaspoon whole coriander seed</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons red curry paste</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups baby potatoes <em>cut into bite-size pieces</em></li>
        <li>2 large carrots <em>peeled and diced 1/4-inch thick</em></li>
        <li>2 14-ounce cans light fat coconut milk (sub up to 1 can with full-fat coconut milk for creamier, richer curry</li>
        <li>1-1 ½ cups water</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 dash each cardamom and nutmeg</li>
        <li>2-3 tablespoons coconut aminos <em>or sub soy sauce</em></li>
        <li>1-2 tablespoons maple syrup or coconut sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons peanut butter</li>
        <li>1-2 tablespoons lime juice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><p>Heat a large pot or dutch oven (we like this one) over medium heat. Once hot, add oil (or water) and shallot. Sauté 2 minutes, stirring frequently. Turn down heat if browning too quickly.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add whole cumin and coriander seeds (or powder) and sauté for another 1-2 minutes, stirring frequently. Then add red curry paste and stir to combine. Cook for 1 minute more.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add potatoes and carrots and stir to coat. Cook for 2 minutes. Then add coconut milk, water (starting with the lesser amount), cinnamon, cardamom, nutmeg, coconut aminos, maple syrup, and peanut butter. (Reserve lime juice for later).</p></li>
        <li><p>The liquid should cover all of the ingredients — if it does not, add a bit more coconut milk or water to cover. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat</p><p>Once it reaches a low boil, reduce heat to a simmer (add meat at this time if cooking with shrimp or chicken) and cook for 10-15 minutes uncovered. You don’t want it boiling, so ensure it’s cooking over low heat at a simmer.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add lime in the last few minutes of cooking and stir. Then taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more lime for acidity, salt or coconut aminos for saltiness, curry paste for heat / more intense curry taste, maple syrup for sweetness, cinnamon or nutmeg for warmth, or peanut butter for creaminess / more intense peanut flavor. </p><p>Stir and cook a few minutes more. Then turn off heat and let stand for at least 5 minutes before serving (this allows the flavors to meld).</p></li>
        <li><p>To serve, divide between serving bowls and enjoy as is or with a side of rice, cauliflower rice, quinoa, or steamed greens (optional). Fresh lime juice, cilantro, and roasted peanuts (optional) make lovely additions as well.</p></li>
