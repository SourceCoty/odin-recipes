   <p><em>This tom kha gai soup recipe (or Thai coconut chicken soup) is absolutely perfect. Rich and creamy yet tangy and salty, this Thai coconut chicken soup recipe is filling but light and positively bursting with flavor. The very best tom kha gai recipe I’ve ever made or tried. With Whole30, paleo, and vegan options, too. </em></p>
    
    <h2>My Favorite Thai-Inspired Soup</h2>
    
    <p>Let’s go ahead and talk about the best soup of all time.</p>
    
    <p>That’s right: tom kha soup. AKA <em>Thai coconut chicken soup</em>. AKA <em>tom kha gai</em>.</p>

    <p>So here’s the deal: this tom kha gai (Thai coconut chicken soup) is perfection. It’s creamy and a bit tart and salty and a bit sweet, and the chicken is tender, and the mushrooms are filling, and the fresh cilantro adds the perfect herbaceous edge, and I can’t get enough of this soup. I don’t think you’d ever need another Whole30 Thai coconut chicken soup recipe, or heck, a plain ol’ non Whole30 Thai coconut chicken soup recipe for that matter, because this recipe is so damn good.</p>
